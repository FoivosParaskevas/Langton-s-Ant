# Langtons-Ant

Basic form and Variations of Langton's Ant, with gui.

## Abstract

Langton’s ant is an example of “Cellular Automata”, which means that in its most simple form it can be 
found in two different states, black and white, that are defined from two rules. If the ant is on a white 
box then it turns left and changes the boxes color to black. If the ant is on a black box it turns right 
and changes the boxes color to white. In this project we are going to see and other different variations 
of “Langton’s ant” that have different rules. The fascinating thing about Langton’s ant is that after 
thousands of moves the ant starts to form a pattern, that almost every time is the same. Last and foremost, 
“Langton’s ant” is also an example of Theory of Chaos, which means if a small change happens to the initial 
conditions then the whole course changes and ends up being totally different.
